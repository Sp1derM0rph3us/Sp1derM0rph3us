Hello, world! my name is *Jo√£o Victor*, also known as **SpiderMorpheus**. I'm a 20-years-old Brazilian cybersecurity student at FIAP (Faculdade de Inform√°tica e Adminstra√ß√£o Paulista). Currently I'm undergoing a professional pentesting course [@desecsecurity](), enhancing my knowledge in offensive security, and looking forward to obtaining my first certification: DCPT. I am also a programmer proficient in Python and a student of C/C++. As a former Windows user and currently a Linux user, I'm capable of creating automation scripts using Shell scripting or PowerShell. I am very interested in hardware hacking, OSINT, ICS/SCADA security, and computer networks, which are the areas of cybersec that I most enjoy and delve into deeply everyday. In my spare time, I'm also a music producer, beatmaker, guitarist and vocalist deeply in love with pop culture and Mike Pondsmith's Cyberpunk world.

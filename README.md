Hello, world! my name is *Jo√£o Victor*, also known as **SpiderMorpheus**. I'm a 20 years old brazilian cybersecurity student at FIAP (Faculdade de Inform√°tica e Adminstra√ß√£o Paulista) and I'm currently going through a professional pentesting course [@desecsecurity](), enhancing my knowledge in offensive security and looking forward to get my first certification, DCPT. I'm also a programmer with proficiency in Python and a student of C/C++. As a former Windows user and currently Linux user, I'm able to create automation scripts using Shell scripting or Powershell. Very interested in hardware hacking, OSINT, ICS/SCADA security and computer network, which are the ares of cybersec that I most enjoy and dive deep everyday. In my spare time, I'm a music producer, beatmaker, guitarist and vocalist deeply in love with popculture and Mike Pondsmith's Cyberpunk world.
